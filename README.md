## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a **multithreaded Java implementation** of the popular Set card game, showcasing advanced programming concepts including:

- **Complex Thread Synchronization** - Producer-consumer patterns with thread-safe operations

### 🃏 What is Set?

Set is a card game where players race to identify sets of three cards that satisfy specific pattern rules. Each card has four features (shape, color, number, shading), and a valid set requires that each feature be either all the same or all different across the three cards.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Timer**: Configurable countdown with visual warnings
- **Hint System**: Built-in legal set detection and suggestions

### 🧵 **Advanced Threading Architecture**

- **Dealer Thread**: Main game controller managing game flow and validation
- **Player Threads**: Individual threads for each player handling input and actions
- **AI Threads**: Separate threads for computer players with intelligent decision making
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Synchronized data structures and proper concurrency control

### 🎨 **User Interface**

- **Responsive GUI**: Clean Swing-based interface with smooth animations
- **Configurable Layout**: Customizable grid dimensions and visual elements
- **Real-time Updates**: Live score tracking and timer display
- **Keyboard Mapping**: Intuitive key bindings for fast gameplay

### ⚙️ **Configuration System**

- **Atomic Operations**: Thread-safe score and state updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8+** (tested with OpenJDK 11+)
- **Maven** (optional, for dependency management)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoavSilber/SetCardGame.git
   cd SetCardGame
   ```

2. **Compile the project**

   ```bash
   javac -cp . java/bguspl/set/*.java java/bguspl/set/ex/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   java -cp java bguspl.set.Main
   ```

### 🎛️ Configuration

Customize gameplay by editing `resources/config.properties`:

```properties
# Player Configuration
HumanPlayers=2          # Number of human players
ComputerPlayers=2       # Number of AI players
PlayerNames=Alice,Bob,AI1,AI2

# Game Settings
TurnTimeoutSeconds=20   # Time limit per round
PointFreezeSeconds=1    # Freeze time for correct set
PenaltyFreezeSeconds=3  # Freeze time for wrong set
TableDelaySeconds=0.1   # Card placement animation delay

# Display Settings
CellWidth=258           # Card cell width in pixels
CellHeight=167          # Card cell height in pixels
FontSize=40             # UI font size
```

## 🎯 Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Advanced Multithreading**

```java
// Producer-Consumer pattern with blocking queues
private final BlockingQueue<Integer> keys = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(3);

// Thread-safe player validation queue
private final Queue<Player> playersNeedingChecking = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

// Synchronized critical sections
public synchronized void placeToken(int playerId, int slot) {
    // Thread-safe token placement logic
}
```

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**

```java
// Player thread waiting for dealer validation
if (tokenCounter == 3) {
    dealer.addPlayerForChecking(this);
    synchronized(this) {
        wait(); // Wait for dealer response
    }
}
```

### 3. **State Management**

```java
// Atomic state transitions with proper synchronization
private volatile boolean terminate;
private volatile boolean gameOn;
```
